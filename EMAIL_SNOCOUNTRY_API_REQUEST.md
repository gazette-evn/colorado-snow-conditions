# Email to SnoCountry - API Access Request

**Subject:** API Access Request - Colorado Ski Conditions Data Project

---

Hi Andrew,

I'm working on an automated data visualization project that displays live snow conditions for Colorado ski resorts, and I came across the SnoCountry API which looks like exactly what I need.

**Project Overview:**
- Automated updates of Colorado ski resort conditions (16 resorts)
- Interactive map showing resort locations with current conditions
- Sortable table displaying snow depth, new snowfall, lifts, and terrain status
- Updates every 2 hours via automated pipeline
- Data visualized through Datawrapper charts

**Data Needs:**
- Snow conditions (base depth, new snowfall by timeframe)
- Resort operating status
- Lifts and trails (open counts)
- Updates during ski season (November - April)

**Questions:**
1. Is API access available for this type of project?
2. What are the pricing options or tiers?
3. Does the free tier (if available) support automated updates?
4. What's the rate limit for API calls?
5. How frequently is the data updated during ski season?

I'd be happy to provide more details about the project or discuss how to properly attribute SnoCountry as the data source.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

Hi Andrew,

I'm building an automated ski conditions tracker for Colorado resorts and would like to use the SnoCountry API for snow depth, lifts, and trail data.

The project updates visualizations every 2 hours showing current conditions for 16 Colorado ski areas. 

Could you let me know:
- API access options and pricing
- Rate limits
- How to get started?

Happy to discuss the project in more detail!

Thanks,
